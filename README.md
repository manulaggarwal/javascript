# Javascript
Problem statements with JS solution.
# Brackets-Validation:

This JS implementation validates whether correct brackets are entered and in the correct order. It uses regular expression to seperate brackets('{','}','(',')','<','>','[',']') from the string.

Example:-

The read() takes an string array input. 
Input:-
<b>["{{zz}}","[]c{}<>()","{{[[<ff>({})]]}}","{{]]{}<>","{]}"]</b>

Output:-
<b>["YES","YES","YES","NO","NO"]</b>
