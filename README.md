# React-Redux

react-redux tutorial files.

Use this project to manipulate files for better understanding of redux in react. This includes the most basic of setup
as provided in the redux guide from the official page http://redux.js.org

Use it to your advantage and make changes accordingly.
Note:- The app won't run right away even after npm i , some configuration has to be done in order to make it working. Will update soon!
